The first vessel takes twice the volume of water that the second vessel requires to fill upto a particular common height. Is the force exerted by the water on the base of the vessel the same in the two cases? If so, why do the vessels filled with water to that same height give different readings on a weighing scale? Ans. Yes Two vessels having the same base area have identical force and equal pressure acting on their common base area. Since the shapes of the two vessels are different, the force exerted on the sides of the vessels has non-zero vertical components. When these vertical components are added, the total force on one vessel comes out to be greater than that on the other vessel. Hence, when these vessels are filled with water to the same height, they give different readings on a weighing scale. 6 ","CBSE Class 11 physics Important Questions Chapter 10 Mechanical Properties of Fluids 2 Marks Questions 1.Write the characteristics of displacement?

Explain why (a) The blood pressure in humans is greater at the feet than at the brain (b) Atmospheric pressure at a height of about 6 km decreases to nearly half of its value at the sea level, though the height of the atmosphere is more than 100 km (c) Hydrostatic pressure is a scalar quantity even though pressure is force divided by area. Ans:(a) The pressure of a liquid is given by the relation: P = h g Where, P = Pressure h = Height of the liquid column = Density of the liquid g = Acceleration due to the gravity It can be inferred that pressure is directly proportional to height. Hence, the blood pressure in human vessels depends on the height of the blood column in the body. The height of the blood column is more at the feet than it is at the brain. Hence, the blood pressure at the feet is more than it is at the brain. (b) Density of air is the maximum near the sea level. Density of air decreases with increase in height from the surface. At a height of about 6 km, density decreases to nearly half of its 62 ","value at the sea level. Atmospheric pressure is proportional to density. Hence, at a height of 6 km from the surface, it decreases to nearly half of its value at the sea level. (c) When force is applied on a liquid, the pressure in the liquid is transmitted in all directions. Hence, hydrostatic pressure does not have a fixed direction and it is a scalar physical quantity. 2.

(b) increases; decreases Most fluids offer resistance to their motion. This is like internal mechanical friction, known as viscosity. Viscosity of gases increases with temperature, while viscosity of liquids decreases with temperature.

Where, 66 ","= Area of pipe1 = Area of pipe 2 = Speed of the fluid in pipe1 = Speed of the fluid in pipe 2 From the law of continuity, we have: When the area of cross-section in the middle of the venturimeter is small, the speed of the flow of liquid through this part is more. According to Bernoulli's principle, if speed is more, then pressure is less. Pressure is directly proportional to height. Hence, the level of water in pipe 2 is less. Therefore, figure (a) is not possible. 6. (a) What is the largest average velocity of blood flow in an artery of radius m if the flow must remain laminar? (b) What is the corresponding flow rate?

Let a downward force f be applied on the piston C. Then the pressure exerted on the liquid, P 73 ","= Acc to Pascal’s law, this pressure is transmitted equally to piston of cylinder D. ∴ Upward fore acting on the piston of cylinder D will be : → F = PA = As A ≫ a, F ≫ f i.e. small fore applied on the smaller piston will be appearing as a very large force on the large piston.

Explain why (a) The angle of contact of mercury with glass is obtuse, while that of water with glass is acute. 75 ","(b) Water on a clean glass surface tends to spread out while mercury on the same surface tends to form drops. (Put differently, water wets glass while mercury does not.) (c) Surface tension of a liquid is independent of the area of the surface (d) Water with detergent dissolved in it should have small angles of contact. (e) A drop of liquid under no external forces is always spherical in shape Ans.(a) The angle between the tangent to the liquid surface at the point of contact and the surface inside the liquid is called the angle of contact ( θ ), as shown in the given figure. are the respective interfacial tensions between the liquid-air, solid-air, and solid-liquid interfaces. At the line of contact, the surface forces between the three media must be in equilibrium, i.e., The angle of contact θ , is obtuse if (as in the case of mercury on glass). This angle 76 ","is acute if (as in the case of water on glass). (b) Mercury molecules (which make an obtuse angle with glass) have a strong force of attraction between themselves and a weak force of attraction toward solids. Hence, they tend to form drops. On the other hand, water molecules make acute angles with glass. They have a weak force of attraction between themselves and a strong force of attraction toward solids. Hence, they tend to spread out. (c) Surface tension is the force acting per unit length at the interface between the plane of a liquid and any other surface. This force is independent of the area of the liquid surface. Hence, surface tension is also independent of the area of the liquid surface. (d) Water with detergent dissolved in it has small angles of contact ( θ ). This is because for a small θ , there is a fast capillary rise of the detergent in the cloth. The capillary rise of a liquid is directly proportional to the cosine of the angle of contact ( θ ). If θ is small, then cos θ will be large and the rise of the detergent water in the cloth will be fast. (e) A liquid tends to acquire the minimum surface area because of the presence of surface tension. The surface area of a sphere is the minimum for a given volume. Hence, under no external forces, liquid drops always take spherical shape. 5. Explain why (a) To keep a piece of paper horizontal, you should blow over, not under, it (b) When we try to close a water tap with our fingers, fast jets of water gush through the openings between our fingers (c) The size of the needle of a syringe controls flow rate better than the thumb pressure exerted by a doctor while administering an injection (d) A fluid flowing out of a small hole in a vessel results in a backward thrust on the vessel (e) A spinning cricket ball in air does not follow a parabolic trajectory 77 ","Ans.(a) When air is blown under a paper, the velocity of air is greater under the paper than it is above it. As per Bernoulli's principle, atmospheric pressure reduces under the paper. This makes the paper fall. To keep a piece of paper horizontal, one should blow over it. This increases the velocity of air above the paper. As per Bernoulli's principle, atmospheric pressure reduces above the paper and the paper remains horizontal. (b) According to the equation of continuity: = Constant For a smaller opening, the velocity of flow of a fluid is greater than it is when the opening is bigger. When we try to close a tap of water with our fingers, fast jets of water gush through the openings between our fingers. This is because very small openings are left for the water to flow out of the pipe. Hence, area and velocity are inversely proportional to each other. (c) The small opening of a syringe needle controls the velocity of the blood flowing out. This is because of the equation of continuity. At the constriction point of the syringe system, the flow rate suddenly increases to a high value for a constant thumb pressure applied. (d) When a fluid flows out from a small hole in a vessel, the vessel receives a backward thrust. A fluid flowing out from a small hole has a large velocity according to the equation of continuity: = Constant According to the law of conservation of momentum, the vessel attains a backward velocity because there are no external forces acting on the system. (e) A spinning cricket ball has two simultaneous motions - rotatory and linear. These two types of motion oppose the effect of each other. This decreases the velocity of air flowing below the ball. Hence, the pressure on the upper side of the ball becomes lesser than that on the lower side. An upward force acts upon the ball. Therefore, the ball takes a curved path. It does not follow a parabolic path. 6. Glycerine flows steadily through a horizontal tube of length 1.5 m and radius 1.0 cm.

Speed of wind on the upper surface of the wing, = 70 m/s Speed of wind on the lower surface of the wing, = 63 m/s Area of the wing, A = 2.5 Density of air, = 1.3 kg According to Bernoulli's theorem, we have the relation: Where, 80 ","= Pressure on the upper surface of the wing = Pressure on the lower surface of the wing The pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of the wing provides lift to the aeroplane.

(1 atmospheric pressure is ). Ans. Excess pressure inside the soap bubble is 20 Pa; Pressure inside the air bubble is Soap bubble is of radius, r = 5.00 mm = Surface tension of the soap solution, S = Relative density of the soap solution = 1.20 ∴ Density of the soap solution, 81 ","Air bubble formed at a depth, h = 40 cm = 0.4 m Radius of the air bubble, r = 5 mm = 1 atmospheric pressure = Acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 Hence, the excess pressure inside the soap bubble is given by the relation: = 20 Pa Therefore, the excess pressure inside the soap bubble is 20 Pa. The excess pressure inside the air bubble is given by the relation: = 10 Pa Therefore, the excess pressure inside the air bubble is 10 Pa.

Explanation: (a) The P -T phase diagram for is shown in the following figure. 23 ","At 1 atm pressure and at -60°C, lies to the left of -56.6°C (triple point C). Hence, it lies in the region of vaporous and solid phases. Thus, C condenses into the solid state directly, without going through the liquid state. (b) At 4 atm pressure, lies below 5.11 atm (triple point C). Hence, it lies in the region of vaporous and solid phases. Thus, it condenses into the solid state directly, without passing through the liquid state. (c) When the temperature of a mass of solid (at 10 atm pressure and at -65°C) is increased, it changes to the liquid phase and then to the vaporous phase. It forms a line parallel to the temperature axis at 10 atm. The fusion and boiling points are given by the intersection point where this parallel line cuts the fusion and vaporisation curves.

Explain why: (a) a body with large reflectivity is a poor emitter (b) a brass tumbler feels much colder than a wooden tray on a chilly day (c) an optical pyrometer (for measuring high temperatures) calibrated for an ideal black body radiation gives too low a value for the temperature of a red hot iron piece in the open, but gives a correct value for the temperature when the same piece is in the furnace (d) the earth without its atmosphere would be inhospitably cold (e) heating systems based on circulation of steam are more efficient in warming a building than those based on circulation of hot water Ans.(a) A body with a large reflectivity is a poor absorber of light radiations. A poor absorber will in turn be a poor emitter of radiations. Hence, a body with a large reflectivity is a poor emitter. (b) Brass is a good conductor of heat. When one touches a brass tumbler, heat is conducted from the body to the brass tumbler easily. Hence, the temperature of the body reduces to a lower value and one feels cooler. Wood is a poor conductor of heat. When one touches a wooden tray, very little heat is conducted from the body to the wooden tray. Hence, there is only a negligible drop in the temperature of the body and one does not feel cool. Thus, a brass tumbler feels colder than a wooden tray on a chilly day. (c) An optical pyrometer calibrated for an ideal black body radiation gives too low a value 27 ","for temperature of a red hot iron piece kept in the open. Black body radiation equation is given by: Where, E = Energy radiation T = Temperature of optical pyrometer = Temperature of open space = Constant Hence, an increase in the temperature of open space reduces the radiation energy. When the same piece of iron is placed in a furnace, the radiation energy, (d) Without its atmosphere, earth would be inhospitably cold. In the absence of atmospheric gases, no extra heat will be trapped. All the heat would be radiated back from earth's surface. (e) A heating system based on the circulation of steam is more efficient in warming a building than that based on the circulation of hot water. This is because steam contains surplus heat in the form of latent heat (540 cal/g). 11. A body cools from 80 °C to 50 °C in 5 minutes. Calculate the time it takes to cool from 60 °C to 30 °C.

Explain why (a) Two bodies at different temperatures and if brought in thermal contact do not 84 ","necessarily settle to the mean temperature . (b) The coolant in a chemical or a nuclear plant (i.e., the liquid used to prevent the different parts of a plant from getting too hot) should have high specific heat. (c) Air pressure in a car tyre increases during driving. (d) The climate of a harbour town is more temperate than that of a town in a desert at the same latitude. Ans.(a) When two bodies at different temperatures and are brought in thermal contact, heat flows from the body at the higher temperature to the body at the lower temperature till equilibrium is achieved, i.e., the temperatures of both the bodies become equal. The equilibrium temperature is equal to the mean temperature only when the thermal capacities of both the bodies are equal. (b) The coolant in a chemical or nuclear plant should have a high specific heat. This is because higher the specific heat of the coolant, higher is its heat-absorbing capacity and vice versa. Hence, a liquid having a high specific heat is the best coolant to be used in a nuclear or chemical plant. This would prevent different parts of the plant from getting too hot. (c) When a car is in motion, the air temperature inside the car increases because of the motion of the air molecules. According to Charles' law, temperature is directly proportional to pressure. Hence, if the temperature inside a tyre increases, then the air pressure in it will also increase. (d) A harbour town has a more temperate climate (i.e., without the extremes of heat or cold) than a town located in a desert at the same latitude. This is because the relative humidity in a harbour town is more than it is in a desert town. 4. A cylinder with a movable piston contains 3 moles of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure. The walls of the cylinder are made of a heat insulator, and the piston is insulated by having a pile of sand on it. By what factor does the pressure of the gas increase if the gas is compressed to half its original volume? Ans. The cylinder is completely insulated from its surroundings. As a result, no heat is 85 ","exchanged between the system (cylinder) and its surroundings. Thus, the process is adiabatic. Initial pressure inside the cylinder = Final pressure inside the cylinder = Initial volume inside the cylinder = Final volume inside the cylinder = Ratio of specific heats, Y = 1.4 For an adiabatic process, we have: The final volume is compressed to half of its initial volume. ∴ Hence, the pressure increases by a factor of 2.639. 5. In changing the state of a gas adiabatically from an equilibrium state A to another equilibrium state B , an amount of work equal to 22.3 J is done on the system. If the gas is taken from state A to B via a process in which the net heat absorbed by the system is 9.35 cal, how much is the net work done by the system in the latter case? (Take 1 cal = 4.19 J) 86 ","Ans .The work done ( W ) on the system while the gas changes from state A to state B is 22.3 J. This is an adiabatic process. Hence, change in heat is zero. ∴ Δ Q =0 Δ W = –22.3 J (Since the work is done on the system) From the first law of thermodynamics, we have: Δ Q =Δ U +Δ W Where, Δ U = Change in the internal energy of the gas ∴ Δ U =Δ Q –Δ W = –(–22.3 J) Δ U = + 22.3 J When the gas goes from state A to state B via a process, the net heat absorbed by the system is: Δ Q = 9.35 cal = 9.35 4.19 = 39.1765 J Heat absorbed, Δ Q =Δ U +Δ Q ∴ Δ W =Δ Q –Δ U = 39.1765 – 22.3 = 16.8765 J Therefore, 16.88 J of work is done by the system. 6.

(b) What is the change in internal energy of the gas? (c) What is the change in the temperature of the gas? (d) Do the intermediate states of the system (before settling to the final equilibrium state) lie on its P-V-T surface? Ans.(a) 0.5 atm (b) Zero (c) Zero (d) No Explanation: (a) The volume available to the gas is doubled as soon as the stopcock between cylinders A and B is opened. Since volume is inversely proportional to pressure, the pressure will decrease to one-half of the original value. Since the initial pressure of the gas is 1 atm, the pressure in each cylinder will be 0.5 atm. (b) The internal energy of the gas can change only when work is done by or on the gas. Since in this case no work is done by or on the gas, the internal energy of the gas will not change. (c) Since no work is being done by the gas during the expansion of the gas, the temperature of the gas will not change at all. (d) The given process is a case of free expansion. It is rapid and cannot be controlled. The intermediate states do not satisfy the gas equation and since they are in non-equilibrium states, they do not lie on the P -V -T surface of the system. 88 ","CBSE Class 11 physics Important Questions Chapter 12 Thermodynamics 5 Marks Questions 1.Derive the equation of state for adiabatic change?

Explain why (or how): (a) In a sound wave, a displacement node is a pressure antinode and vice versa, (b) Bats can ascertain distances, directions, nature, and sizes of the obstacles without any eyes, (c) A violin note and sitar note may have the same frequency, yet we can distinguish between the two notes, (d) Solids can support both longitudinal and transverse waves, but only longitudinal waves can propagate in gases, and (e) The shape of a pulse gets distorted during propagation in a dispersive medium. Ans.(a) A node is a point where the amplitude of vibration is the minimum and pressure is the maximum. On the other hand, an antinode is a point where the amplitude of vibration is the maximum and pressure is the minimum. Therefore, a displacement node is nothing but a pressure antinode, and vice versa. (b) Bats emit very high-frequency ultrasonic sound waves. These waves get reflected back toward them by obstacles. A bat receives a reflected wave (frequency) and estimates the distance, direction, nature, and size of an obstacle with the help of its brain senses. (c) The overtones produced by a sitar and a violin, and the strengths of these overtones, are 46 ","different. Hence, one can distinguish between the notes produced by a sitar and a violin even if they have the same frequency of vibration. (d) Solids have shear modulus. They can sustain shearing stress. Since fluids do not have any definite shape, they yield to shearing stress. The propagation of a transverse wave is such that it produces shearing stress in a medium. The propagation of such a wave is possible only in solids, and not in gases. Both solids and fluids have their respective bulk moduli. They can sustain compressive stress. Hence, longitudinal waves can propagate through solids and fluids. 3. One end of a long string of linear mass density is connected to an electrically driven tuning fork of frequency 256 Hz.

The wind is blowing toward the observer. Hence, the effective speed of the sound increases by 10 units, i.e., Effective speed of the sound, = 340 + 10 = 350 m/s The wavelength ( ) of the sound heard by the observer is given by the relation: For the running observer: Velocity of the observer, = 10 m/s The observer is moving toward the source.
